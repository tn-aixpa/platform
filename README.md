You can then run `helm search repo digitalhub` to see the charts.

## Security Policy

The current release is the supported version. Security fixes are released together with all other fixes in each new release.

## Contributing

To report a bug or request a feature, please first check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. If none exist, open a new issue with a clear title and a detailed description, including any steps to reproduce if it's a bug.

To contribute code, start by forking the repository. Clone your fork locally and create a new branch for your changes. Make sure your commits follow the [Conventional Commits v1.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to keep history readable and consistent.

Once your changes are ready, push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the main branch. Be sure to include a summary of what you changed and why. If your pull request addresses an issue, mention it in the description (e.g., “Closes #123”).

Please note that new contributors may be asked to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their pull requests can be merged. This helps us ensure compliance with open source licensing standards.
